Dear IDC Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the possibility of scheduling a call with your team to verify if our mockup design for the application we are creating from scratch using the inside design component, which works natively, is aligned with your system.

We understand that the IDC system has unique design components that are integral to the system's functionality. Therefore, we believe it is crucial to ensure that our mockup design is compatible with your system to avoid any issues down the line.

As we are creating the application from scratch, we would appreciate your team's assistance in verifying that our mockup is aligned with your system. We would like to schedule a call at your earliest convenience to discuss this further and clarify any queries we may have.

Please let us know your availability for a call, and we will schedule the call accordingly. We are excited about this project and look forward to collaborating with your team to ensure a seamless integration with your system.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
